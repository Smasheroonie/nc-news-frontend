# Northcoders News Front End

Welcome to my News Front End Project!

I created this project during my JavaScript Software Development Bootcamp at Northcoders. It builds on the backend API I created earlier in the bootcamp, delivering a responsive React-based news site. It features:

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible semantic HTML
- Reactive elements built according to user stories
- Organised file structure and reusable components
- Use of TailwindCSS for a modern approach to styling
- Implemented React Router more shareable and dynamic URLs
- Loading state and optimistic rendering for enhanced UX

The back end of the project can be viewed [here.](https://github.com/Smasheroonie/news-api-backend)

The hosted site can be viewed [here.](https://luke-g-nc-news.netlify.app/)

(Please note that there may be a small spin-up period when first loading the site.)
